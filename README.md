# flight-finder

An intelligent flight search application that uses AI agents to find and compare flights across different booking platforms. Built with CrewAI, Selenium web scraping, and Google's Gemini AI for smart flight recommendations.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Get your Gemini API key and enter it in the sidebar
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Enter your travel details and let AI agents find the best flights!

## How it Works
The app uses specialized AI agents - one for flight searching and another for summarizing results - to scrape flight data and provide intelligent recommendations with booking links.
